Note on new features: while Zellij tries to be as user friendly as possible, it must also be friendly to its maintainers. We take great care in considering which features should be included in the core Zellij functionality - because each such feature means more maintenance overhead for the project.

On the other hand, we know our users care about the program a great deal and would like to see it improve. For this reason, we try to make an effort to allow users to develop their desired new features as Zellij plugins (https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins). Please consider whether your feature can be a plugin itself, and if not - try to think which APIs you need in order to make it possible. A feature request for a plugin API will likely be given higher priority than one for a Zellij core feature.

** Note on comparisons to tmux: Zellij is not, nor does it try to be, a tmux clone. While we appreciate that many people use it as a tmux alternative and are missing their favorite features - this is not what we do here. There are often native alternatives to tmux features that Zellij does differently. We would encourage you to look into those alternatives rather than try to make it work exactly like tmux. A good place to start would be our FAQ: https://zellij.dev/documentation/faq

We believe each program has its strengths and weaknesses, and hope that users would want to use Zellij for what it can do, rather than trying to make it behave like something it does not want to be. Thank you for understanding! **
